# Camel Transacted + Salesforce Reproducer

## The Problem
Salesforce operations inside transacted routes get hung up or deadlocked

## Running
This reproducer requires a working saleforce org and credentials. A developer org or scratch org is fine. Populate credentials in `application.properties`. Then just run `TransactedTest`.
